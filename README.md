# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project applies logistic regression and decision tree models to analyze heart disease risk using the publicly available Framingham dataset.

## Objectives
- Perform data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- Train supervised machine learning models  
- Compare predictive performance  
- Understand key health indicators associated with heart disease  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

## Dataset
Framingham Heart Study Dataset (publicly available).

## Results
Both models were evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess predictive performance.

## Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of data preprocessing, classification techniques, and practical machine learning workflows.
